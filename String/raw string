"""Raw Strings

A raw string literal is preceded by r or R, which specifies that escape sequences in the associated string are not translated. The backslash character is left in the string:
>>> print('foo\nbar') 
           foo 
           bar
>>> print(r'foo\nbar') 
           foo\nbar


 Raw strings don't treat the backslash as a special character at all. Every character you put into a raw string stays the way you wrote it:
	print ('C:\\nowhere' )
This would print following result:
	C:\nowhere 
Now let's make use of raw string. We would put expression in r'expression' as follows:
	print (r'C:\\nowhere' )
This would print following result:
	C:\\nowhere
