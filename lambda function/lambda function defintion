Python Lambda-Syntax and Structure

Syntax :
    lambda arguments: expression

arguments:
     These are the input parameters, similar to what you'd pass to a regular function.

expression:
     The operation or computation to perform, which is returned as the result.

Python Lambda-When to Uses?

Inline Functions: Useful when you need a small function for a short period, and defining a full function using def would be too verbose.

Functional Programming: Often used with functions like map(), filter(), and reduce() where a function is required as an argument.

Sorting and Key Functions: Lambda functions can be used as the key argument in functions like sorted(), min(), and max() to specify a custom sort order.
